qn1:

write a program that adds two numbers prints the sum to STDOUT  .
read the input from STDIN. the first line of your input will contain
an integer (N) that tells you how many more lines there are in the
input each of the subsequent N lines contains 2 integers. you need to
print the sum of each pair on a separate line of STDOUT.

sample input

3
1   5
3   10 
999   -34343

Sample Output:

6
13
-33344

program:

t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n,m=map(int,input().split())
    print(n+m)



qn2:

Mr Jhon and Mr Javid are best friends, and javid is habbituated to
read in right to left, write a logic to take a number in jhon point
of view and print it in Javid perspective



i/p:

1234

o/p:

4321

program:

n=int(input())
s=0
while n!=0:
    r=n%10
    s=s*10+r
    n=n//10
print(s)


qn3;

Given a long integer, we need to find if the difference between sum of odd position digits and sum of even position digits is 0 or not. The indexes start from zero (0 index is for leftmost digit).

Examples:

Input : 1212112
Output : Yes
Explanation:-
the odd position element is 2+2+1=5
the even position element is 1+1+1+2=5
the difference is 5-5=0.so print yes.

Input :12345
Output : No
Explanation:-
the odd position element is 1+3+5=9
the even position element is 2+4=6
the difference is 9-6=3 not  equal
to zero. So print no.

program:

n=int(input())  #1212112
s1=0
s2=0
while n!=0:
    r=n%10  #2
    n=n//10  #121211
    s1=s1+r  #2
    r=n%10  
    n=n//10
    s2=s2+r
s3=abs(s1-s2)
if s3==0:
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")

qn4:

find out whether given number is palindrome or not

 palindrome: if given number and its reversed number are the same then its a palindrome

Sample Input1:

234

sample Ouput1:

not palindrome

Sample Input2:

121

sample Ouput2:

palindrome

program:

n=int(input())  #4664
s=n
p=0
while n!=0:
    r=n%10  #4 6 6 4
    p=p*10+r  #4 46 466 4664
    n=n//10  #466 46 4
if s==p:
    print("palindrome")
else:
    print("not palindrome")


qn5:

Write A Program to find the Largest digit in a given number and
display output as given below.



Example: 
Input- 1987
Output- 9

program;

n=int(input())  #1987  
d=0
l=0
while n!=0:
    r=n%10  #7  8 9 1
    d=r  #d=7 8 9 1
    if d>=l: # true true true
        l=d  #l=7 8 9
    
    n=n//10  #198 19 1
print(l)

qn6:

Sandhya, a software analyst bought a new split-Ac to her house.
She was researching her Acâ€™s temperature limits by increasing and
decreasing. The table is as follows

Sample Input

Sample Output

>=16 and<=25

very cool

>25 and <=32

cool

>32

no effect

                 

 
 
Sample input1:
17
Sample Output1:
very cool
Sample Input 2:
35
Sample Output:
no effect

program:

n=int(input())
if n>=16 and n<=25:
    print("very cool")
elif n>25 and n<=32:
    print("cool")
elif n>32:
    print("no effect")
